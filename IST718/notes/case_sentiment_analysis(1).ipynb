    "In previous versions of Spark, most Machine Learning funcionality was provided through RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets).

Future releases of Spark will not update the support of ML with RDDs.\n",

The _Pipeline_, therefore, can be fit to the data because the final step of the process (the _Estimator_) is fit to the data.

When troubling questions arise about this boy\\'s (story), however, Gabriel finds himself drawn into a widening mystery that hides a deadly secret\\x85\" according to film\\'s official synopsis.<br /><br />You really should STOP reading these comments, and watch the film NOW...<br /><br />The \"How did he lose his leg?\" ending, with Ms. Collette planning her new life, should be chopped off, and sent to \"deleted scenes\" land. It\\'s overkill. The true nature of her physical and mental ailments should be obvious, by the time Mr. Williams returns to New York. Possibly, her blindness could be in question - but a revelation could have be made certain in either the \"highway\" or \"video tape\" scenes. The film would benefit from a re-editing - how about a \"director\\'s cut\"? <br /><br />Williams and Bobby Cannavale (as Jess) don\\'t seem, initially, believable as a couple. A scene or two establishing their relationship might have helped set the stage. Otherwise, the cast is exemplary. Williams offers an exceptionally strong characterization, and not a \"gay impersonation\". Sandra Oh (as Anna), Joe Morton (as Ashe), and Rory Culkin (Pete Logand) are all perfect.<br /><br />Best of all, Collette\\'s \"Donna\" belongs in the creepy hall of fame. Ms. Oh is correct in saying Collette might be, \"you know, like that guy from \\'Psycho\\'.\" There have been several years when organizations giving acting awards seemed to reach for women, due to a slighter dispersion of roles; certainly, they could have noticed Collette with some award consideration. She is that good. And, director Patrick Stettner definitely evokes Hitchcock - he even makes getting a sandwich from a vending machine suspenseful.<br /><br />Finally, writers Stettner, Armistead Maupin, and Terry Anderson deserve gratitude from flight attendants everywhere.<br /><br />******* The Night Listener (1/21/06) Patrick Stettner ~ Robin Williams, Toni Collette, Sandra Oh, Rory Culkin', score=1.0)"

Why does Sheen sleepwalk through potentially hot relationships WITH TWO OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SEXY ACTRESSES in the world?

    "\n",
    "Notice how we increase the loss function by $\\lambda$ times the square of the weights. In practice, this means that __we will think twice about increasing the importance of a feature__. This loss function will prevent the algorithm for fitting certain data points, such as outliers or noise, unless the decrease in loss for the data grants it. Also, notice that the penalization doesn't apply to the bias parameter $\\theta_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see more clearly the effect of such cost function when $\\lambda$ goes to infinity: the features will not be used for predicting and only the bias term will matter! This prevents the algorithm from learning altogether, forcing it to underfit!\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with L2 regularization is that all weights go to zero uniformly. In a sense, all features will matter but less than with the unregularized loss function. This is a really strange because we do not want all features to matter. In sentiment analysis, we want to select certain features because we want to understand that only some words have effects on the sentiment.\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical effect of L1 regularization is that the difference between a feature having no importance vs some small importance is massively bigger than with L2 regularization. __Therefore, optimizing the L1 loss function usually brings some features to have exactly zero weight.__\n",

    "One problem with L1 regularization is that it will never select more features than the number of examples. This is because it can always fit the training data perfectly when the number of features equals the number of examples. In our sentimental analysis, this is the case (there are more words than examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of remedying this is to have a combination of both L1 and L2. This is known as __elastic net regularization__. For this type of regularization, we have to pick a parameter ($\\alpha$) deciding to consider L1 vs L2 regularization. If $\\alpha=0$, then we choose L2, and if $\\alpha=1$ we choose L1. For example, $\\alpha=0.5$ means half L1 and half L2.\n",
